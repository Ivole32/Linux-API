## 2026-02-16 [1]

In this development cycle, I focused primarily on **identifying and fixing bugs**, especially within the **user management routes**. Several edge cases and unintended behaviors surfaced during testing, particularly around user deletion, role changes, and state transitions. Resolving these issues significantly improved the stability and predictability of the system.

While reviewing safety concerns, I intentionally skipped implementing protections against self-destructive actions for now. The following note reflects that decision:

> *"To prevent these scenarios, I will implement safeguards to block self-destructive actions in the next iteration."*

I chose to postpone this because it did not feel critical at the current stage of development and would have slowed down progress on more immediate stability fixes.

With the most disruptive bugs addressed, the next step is to begin migrating the **core system statistics logic** from the legacy API routes. During this process, I plan not only to port the functionality but also to refactor and improve it to better fit the current architecture and performance goals.

**Next focus:**

* Port system statistics logic from legacy routes
* Refactor and optimize the implementation
* Ensure consistency with the new API structure

This marks the transition from stabilization work to enhancing core functionality.
