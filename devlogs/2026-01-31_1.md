## Automatic Migrations, Backups and Migration Logging

### ✅ Automatic Database Migrations

I have successfully implemented a fully automatic database migration system.  
The system now detects schema changes and applies migrations without requiring manual intervention. This significantly reduces setup time, prevents version mismatches, and ensures that all environments remain synchronized.

The migration process has been designed to be safe and consistent, making it easier to deploy updates and maintain database integrity across development and production environments.

### 💾 Automatic Backup System

Alongside automatic migrations, I implemented a reliable backup system that runs automatically before migrations are executed.  

This ensures that:

- The database state is preserved before any structural changes are applied
- Recovery is possible in case of migration failures
- Data integrity risks are minimized

The backup process is fully integrated into the migration workflow and requires no manual interaction.

### 📊 Migration Logging System

A persistent and reliable migration logging system has now been added to the database.  
This system records detailed information about every migration attempt, including:

- Migration direction (upgrade/downgrade)
- Target revision
- Execution status (success or failure)
- Error information when failures occur
- Timestamp of execution

This logging infrastructure provides full transparency and traceability for database changes and greatly simplifies debugging and maintenance.

### 🚀 Summary

With these features implemented, the database management system is now significantly more robust and production-ready. Automatic migrations, integrated backups, and detailed migration logging together provide a safe and maintainable workflow for future development.
