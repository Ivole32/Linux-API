## Devlog – Database Initialization Fix and Migration Cleanup

### 🛠 Fixed PostgreSQL Initialization Issue

I fixed an issue where the PostgreSQL database was not being created automatically when starting the Docker container. The initialization process has now been corrected to ensure that the required database is reliably created during container startup. This improves the setup process and prevents manual database creation steps.

### 🧹 Migration Code Cleanup

I also removed outdated and unnecessary migration code from the new database structure. This cleanup helps reduce technical debt, improves maintainability, and ensures that the migration system remains clean and easier to manage moving forward.

### 🗄 Continued Work on the New Database System

Development on the new database architecture is still ongoing. Several core functionalities still need to be implemented before the system is fully ready. I am currently working on expanding these features, improving stability, and preparing the database for integration into the production system. Further testing and optimization are in progress to ensure a smooth transition.

### 🚀 Next Steps

The focus now is on finalizing the remaining database features and preparing the implementation for deployment into the live environment.
