## Monitoring & Observability Progress

Today I focused on improving the operational visibility of the API. The goal is to introduce monitoring and health endpoints that make it easy to detect problems quickly in production and understand system behavior under load.

A major milestone was laying the foundation for persistent metrics storage. I finalized the initial database structures for metrics and integrated TimescaleDB to efficiently handle time-series data, providing a scalable backbone for performance data and trends.

I also worked on routes to expose database health information and detailed API usage statistics. These endpoints will help inspect request metrics, error code distributions, and overall system health for faster debugging in production.

I haven’t committed most of this work yet, as I’m still refining the implementation before pushing it to the repository.

Although work remains, today marked strong progress toward a more observable system. I am wrapping up after a long session, but the core groundwork is now in place.

### Next Steps

* Implement monitoring endpoints for API health and metrics
* Expose database health status and connection pool state
* Provide detailed statistics for request performance and error codes

Overall, a productive day with meaningful progress toward production-ready monitoring.
