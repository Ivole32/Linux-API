I focused on performance improvements and infrastructure stability in this update.

### Database Optimization

I significantly accelerated database performance by introducing proper indexing. Queries that previously required full table scans are now resolved much more efficiently, reducing latency and CPU load.

### Pgpool Integration with Caching

Pgpool is now integrated directly into the Docker Compose setup with caching enabled. This allows frequently requested data to be served faster without repeatedly hitting the database.

### Performance Improvements

These two changes together resulted in a major performance boost.

Previously, a ZAP scan would generate enormous load on the system. During heavy scans, response times could spike to up to 10 seconds.

Now, even under very high load, response times rarely exceed 600 ms.

### Stability & Release Update

The dev version has been merged into main, as it now feels reliable and production-ready.

### Documentation Rewrite

Outdated documentation was removed to avoid confusion.
