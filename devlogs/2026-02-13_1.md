### Added User Endpoints to v1 Router

Today I added two new endpoints to the **v1 router** to improve user self-management:

* `/me` — allows authenticated users to retrieve their own account information
* `/delete` — allows users to delete their own account

These endpoints are intended to simplify common user actions and prepare the API for more structured account management.

### Issues Encountered

During implementation I ran into several problems that were difficult to diagnose. Because the current logging is minimal, I was unable to clearly identify the root causes of some failures and unexpected behaviors.

### Next Steps

In the coming days I plan to:

* improve logging and error visibility across the API
* continue building additional user management routes
* migrate legacy routers related to system statistics into the new structure

These steps should improve maintainability, observability, and overall API consistency moving forward.
