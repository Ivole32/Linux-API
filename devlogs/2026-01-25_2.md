### Devlog - January 25, 2026

Started implementing backup and migration functions directly in the code.  
The goal is to make database upgrades safer and more automated without relying solely on the CLI.  

Tomorrow, the plan is to attempt integrating the new PostgreSQL database system into the existing codebase and ensure everything works with the updated setup.
