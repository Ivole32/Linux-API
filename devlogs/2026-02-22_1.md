Today I focused on improving the installation experience for **Linux-API**.

I created setup and startup scripts to simplify deployment and reduce the chance of configuration mistakes. The setup script guides users through the installation process, while the startup script makes running the API predictable and convenient in both foreground and background modes.

Alongside the automation work, I wrote the **complete project documentation**. It now includes:

* a fully automated setup path
* a detailed manual setup guide *(recommended)*
* step-by-step server preparation instructions

The manual setup is recommended because it provides better transparency, helps users understand the system, and makes debugging easier if something goes wrong.

Additionally, every configuration option is now documented. Each environment variable and setting is explained so administrators can confidently customize deployments for their own infrastructure.

With deployment streamlined and documentation in place, I consider the project **functionally complete for now**. The current state is stable, understandable, and ready for real-world use.

I’m calling this milestone done — time to ship 🚀
