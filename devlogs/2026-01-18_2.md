## Devlog 2026-01-18 [2]

This is a small interim update reflecting recent committed changes.

I continued working on improving the structure and readability of the codebase, with several refactors now fully committed to keep the project cleaner and easier to maintain.

Development on the new PostgreSQL database implementation is also progressing. The database setup and related changes have been committed, but the new database is not yet integrated into the main application.

Additionally, I worked on general organization and cleanup tasks. More functionality and behavior are now configurable via the config files, improving flexibility without requiring code changes.

This update focuses on internal improvements and preparation for future features rather than a full release.
