I decided to continue my old SoM project called Linux API as part of the Flavortown competition.

Since working on the original version of Linux API, my technical skills and my approach to clean and maintainable software design have improved significantly. Because of this, my current focus is not on adding new features yet, but on refactoring, cleaning up, and restructuring the project.

### Project Cleanup and Refactoring


At the moment, I am going through the project and removing outdated or unnecessary parts to bring the codebase up to my current standards.

So far, I have:

- Completely removed the old pippackage from the repository

- Updated the versions in the requirements file to use more recent and supported dependencies

- Started redesigning the folder structure to make the project clearer and easier to maintain

- Begun improving the documentation alongside the structural changes

This cleanup phase is important to reduce technical debt and ensure the project is easy to work on in the long term.

### New Database System

In parallel, I am working on a new database system using PostgreSQL. Instead of modifying the old data layer, I decided to redesign the database from scratch with a cleaner schema and better scalability in mind.

I am currently designing the tables and their relationships.
An image showing the current database table structure is attached to this update.

### Next Steps

Right now, the focus is on finalizing the new folder structure, improving documentation, and finishing the database design. Once this foundation is solid, I will move on to rebuilding and extending features on top of it.

More updates coming soon.
