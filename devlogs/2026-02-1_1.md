## Devlog - Database System Refactor & Error Handling Improvements

Today I continued working on the new database system and focused on stabilizing the overall structure and reliability.

### ✅ Database Layer Progress
I expanded and refined the new database access layer. The repository-style methods for user records, authentication data, and permission management are now more consistent and better structured. Query execution and transaction handling were reviewed and cleaned up.

### ✅ Improved Error Handling with Custom Exceptions
I significantly improved error handling by introducing dedicated custom exception classes across the database and service layers. Instead of using generic exceptions, the code now raises domain-specific errors, which makes debugging and API responses much clearer and more predictable.

This includes cases such as:
- user not found
- permission record missing
- last admin protection
- creation and deletion failures
- permission update failures

### ✅ Full Documentation Added
I wrote complete docstrings for the entire new database functionality. All core database methods are now documented with:
- purpose
- arguments
- return values
- raised exceptions

This should make future maintenance and extension much easier.

### ✅ Dependencies Updated
Project dependencies were updated to the newest compatible versions to ensure current features, security fixes, and long-term support.

### 🔜 Next Steps
Based on current progress, I expect to integrate and test the new database system tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
