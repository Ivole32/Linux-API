## New auth system for v1 routes

In the past few days, I started implementing the new auth dependencies for the new v1 routes.

### Current Implementation

I was able to implement the auth functionality into the only existing route for the v1 API version (currently in development).

### Issue with Demo Mode Admin API Key

I faced issues when trying to show the default admin API key in demo mode. The bug was that my FastAPI auth dependency was generated before the default API key was created and set as static.

### Fix

After I found that out, I was able to fix it easily.

### Next Steps

Next, I’ll implement more user management endpoints in v1.
