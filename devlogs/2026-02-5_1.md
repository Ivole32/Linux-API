## Devlog – PostgreSQL Migration & API Refactor

Today I continued integrating the PostgreSQL database system into the active backend. The PostgreSQL layer itself was already developed in earlier devlogs. This session focused on connecting it to the running API, starting with the registration flow.

### Progress

* Connected the PostgreSQL system to the backend
* Started integrating it into the registration endpoint
* Began rebuilding API routes to use the new database system

### Legacy Compatibility

* The old SQLite3 database functionality is still included (no sync to new database)
* Existing SQLite-based endpoints are kept as legacy API routes
* Legacy routes remain functional as fallback
* New PostgreSQL routes are being built in parallel
* Migration is happening step by step to avoid breaking changes

### Issues Encountered

* Some queries failed due to schema and type differences
* Constraint handling caused unexpected errors
* Multiple migrations produced schema conflicts/bugs

### Current Status

* PostgreSQL connection is working
* Registration route migration is in progress
* Legacy SQLite routes are still active
* New PostgreSQL-based API routes are partially implemented

### Next Steps

* Continue rebuilding API routes for PostgreSQL
* Gradually replace legacy SQLite endpoints
* Improve database validation and error handling
