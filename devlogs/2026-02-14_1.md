## 2026-02-14 [1]

Added a new `/users` endpoint that allows administrators to retrieve a complete list of registered users.

This endpoint is protected by admin permission checks and includes pagination support to ensure performance and prevent large response payloads. Rate limiting has also been applied to reduce potential abuse and protect system resources.

### Highlights
- Admin-only access control
- Paginated responses for scalability
- Rate limiting for stability and abuse prevention
- Prepared for future filtering and search capabilities

This addition improves system management by giving administrators a clear overview of all users while maintaining performance and security.
