## Devlog – Legacy Endpoint Warning Middleware

I added a custom middleware that detects requests to legacy API endpoints and adds a warning flag to the response headers. This helps clients recognize when they are calling routes that still rely on the old database layer.

### Changes

* Implemented a custom FastAPI middleware
* Middleware checks requests against the legacy API prefix
* Automatically adds deprecation headers for legacy routes

### Purpose

The goal is to clearly signal that certain endpoints are still using the legacy database logic and are not connected to the new v1 database system. This supports the ongoing migration.

More legacy routes will be migrated step by step.
