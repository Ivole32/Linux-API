### Devlog: Implementing PostgreSQL Database Migrations with Alembic

Today I spent some time setting up **database migrations** for our PostgreSQL backend using **Alembic**.  

The main goal was to streamline the development process for our new database system, which currently can only be tested after committing changes on my Linux server. By integrating Alembic migrations, I can now:

- Keep track of schema changes in a structured way
- Apply updates to the database reliably without manual intervention
- Simplify testing and deployment, reducing errors caused by manual schema updates

This setup should make future development **much faster and safer**, especially when iterating on new models and schema modifications.
