### Progress on Database Migration System and Automatic Backups

I continued working on the migration logic of the new database system.

The main focus is currently on implementing reliable backup functionality and automatic database migrations using Alembic. The goal is to ensure that schema changes can be applied safely, while minimizing the risk of data loss by creating backups only when migrations are actually required.

While the core functionality is coming together, I am still running into some difficulties regarding overall code design decisions. In particular, deciding where certain responsibilities should live (for example, how much logic belongs in startup code versus dedicated database or service classes) is proving to be non-trivial.

For now, the priority is correctness and safety over perfect structure. Once the migration and backup flow is stable, I plan to revisit and refine the architecture to make it cleaner and more maintainable.
