Today I added a new feature that allows routes to be disabled directly through the configuration. This makes it easy to control access to specific endpoints without modifying the codebase, which is especially useful for maintenance, staged rollouts, or demo environments.

I also started rewriting the documentation from scratch because the previous version was outdated. I am currently working on making the setup process clearer and ensuring the API is easy to understand and use.
