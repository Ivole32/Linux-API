Today I focused on improving compatibility and maintainability by migrating the old system statistics routes from the legacy routing layer into the **v1 API**.

### Migration of Legacy Statistics Routes
I moved the existing system statistics endpoints from the legacy routes into the v1 structure. Fortunately, this process was straightforward:

- The legacy implementation was already **well-structured**
- Performance was still **solid and efficient**
- Only minimal adjustments were required to match the v1 routing conventions

Because the original codebase was clean and modular, the migration did not introduce regressions or performance issues.

### Configuration Toggle for Legacy Routes
After completing the migration, I added a new configuration option that allows enabling or disabling legacy routes.

**New config option:**
- Toggle legacy routes **on/off**
- Provides flexibility during transition and testing
- Allows gradual deprecation without breaking compatibility

This addition makes it easier to phase out legacy functionality while maintaining backward compatibility when needed.

### Next Steps
Next, I plan to implement dedicated **health endpoints** and supporting middleware to improve system maintainability and enable more efficient debugging and monitoring.
